Before mounting the servo amplifier, it is necessary to note that:

- If the servo amplifier (or motor) is not properly grounded, there is a risk of electric shock.
- Do not use coated mounting plates (non-conductive).
- Protect the servo amplifier from impermissible stress. In particular, make sure that no parts are bent or the insulation distances are changed during transport or handling.
- Do not touch electronic components and contacts.
- Ensure sufficient supply of cold filtered air to the bottom of the cabinet or use a heat exchanger.
- Do not mount devices that generate magnetic fields directly next to the servo amplifier. Strong magnetic fields can directly affect internal components. Install a device that generates a magnetic field at a sufficient distance from the servo amplifier or shield the magnetic field.

Follow the instructions below to install the servo amplifier:

1. Prepare the site, the necessary tools and protective equipment. Install the servo amplifier in a closed cabinet. There must be no materials at the installation site that could cause short circuits or corrosion. Observe the prescribed distances.
2. Check that nothing is blocking the ventilation and ensure that the permissible ambient temperature is observed. Observe the required free space above and below the servo amplifier.
3. If a cooling system is used in the cabinet, position it so that condensed water cannot drip onto the servo amplifier or accessories.
4. Mount the servo amplifier and power supply close to each other on a conductive grounded mounting plate in the cabinet.
5. Ground the servo amplifier.
