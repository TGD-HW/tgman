##General
TGZ digital servo amplifiers represent a new inverter concept for multi-axis applications.
TGZ includes modern digital control elements, simple preset functions that the user can call in their own user program, connection to fast digital buses, connection of modern digital feedback sensors, small power losses and a unique cooling system.
Thanks to the use of these new technologies, it was possible to optimize the dimensions, reduce the number of pins in the connectors and implement two power units for controlling two servomotors in the same space.
TGZ is an economical and high-quality servomotor control solution.
TGZ servo amplifiers are currently offered in several versions determined by number of controlled axes, power supply voltage, type of feedback (Hiperface DSL, EnDAT, SSI) and type of communication (EtherCAT, CANopen, PROFINET).
The type of the feedback and communication is given by installed firmware and can be changed by user.

##Safety instructions
###Safety
Servo amplifiers are components that are mounted in electrical machines and equipment and can only be used as an integral part of these machines and equipment.
During operation, there are risks that can cause property damage, serious injury or death. Do not open the device or touch live parts during operation.
Make sure that all covers and cabinet doors are closed during operation.
Only suitably qualified persons may handle the device during installation and commissioning.
Depending on the degree of protection, some live parts of the servo amplifiers may be exposed during operation.

- The control and power connections may be energized even when the motor is not running.
- The surface of the servo amplifiers may be hot during operation. The heat sink temperature can reach a value higher than 80 °C.

Never disconnect the electrical connections to the servo amplifier when it is energized.
There is a risk of electric arc.
An electric arc can damage the contacts or injure the operator.
After disconnecting the servo amplifier from the power supply, wait at least 7 minutes before touching parts of the device that could be potentially energized (such as contacts) or disconnecting any connections.
Dangerous voltages can be maintained on the capacitors for up to 7 minutes after the power is turned off.
Before handling components, always measure the DC link voltage and wait until it drops below 40 V.
Improper handling of the servo amplifier can cause personal injury or property damage.   

Read this documentation before installing and commissioning the device.
It is essential to observe the technical data and instructions regarding the connection requirements of the device (see nameplate and documentation).   

Transport, installation, commissioning, maintenance and similar activities may only be carried out by suitably qualified personnel.
Properly qualified personnel are those who are familiar with the transport, assembly, installation, commissioning and operation of the product and who have the appropriate professional competence to perform their work.
Qualified persons must know and follow the relevant standards and safety instructions.    

The machine manufacturer must carry out a hazard analysis of the machine and take appropriate measures to ensure that unforeseen movements of the machine do not cause personal injury or property damage.

**This device may not be modified without the permission of the manufacturer.**

The device contains components sensitive to static electricity, which can be destroyed by improper handling.
Discharge the electrostatic charge of your body before touching the device.
Do not touch materials in which an electric charge may accumulate (man-made fibers, plastic film, etc.).
Place the device on a conductive surface.   

The servo amplifiers must only be operated in a closed control cabinet (switchboard) that is suitable for the ambient conditions (temperature 0 to +40 °C, relative humidity 5 to 85% without condensation).
It may be necessary to provide ventilation or cooling to keep the cabinet temperature below 40 °C.
Use only copper wires for connection.
The conductor cross-sections must comply with the ČSN EN 60204 standard.
Other uses of the servo amplifier are not intended and may lead to personal injury and equipment damage.
The servo amplifier must not be used with a machine that does not comply with the relevant national regulations and standards.
The use of a servo amplifier is also prohibited in the following environments:

- an environment where there is a risk of explosion;
- environments with corrosive or electrically conductive substances, such as acids, alkaline solutions, oils, water vapor or dust;
- on boats or on the shore (near the water).

###Transportation
Always transport digital servo amplifiers according to the following instructions:

- Transport may only be performed by qualified personnel. The device must be in the original recyclable packaging of the manufacturer.
- Protect the device from impacts during transport.
- Only transport the device within the specified temperature range: -25 to +70 °C, max. Temperature change rate 20 K/h, class 2K3.
- Only transport the device at the specified humidity: max. 95% relative humidity, non-condensing, class 2K3.

If the packaging is damaged, check that the unit is not visibly damaged. Inform the carrier and manufacturer of any damage to the packaging or product.

###Storage
Always store digital servo amplifiers according to the following instructions:

- Store the device only in the original packaging of the manufacturer.
- When stacking boxes, do not exceed 8 boxes on top of each other.
- Only store the device at the specified temperature range: -25 to +55 °C, max. Temperature change rate 20 K / h, class 1K4.
- Only store the device at the specified humidity range: 5 to 95% relative humidity, non-condensing, class 1K3.

###Maintenance and cleaning
The servo amplifier is maintenance-free. Opening the device (removing the cover) will void the warranty.

###Disassembly of equipment
If the device needs to be removed (for example, for replacement), remove the servo amplifier as follows:

1. Turn off the cabinet power switch and system power fuses.
   After disconnecting the servo amplifier from the power supply, wait at least 7 minutes before touching parts of the device that could be potentially energized (such as contacts) or disconnecting any connections. 
   Always measure the DC link voltage and touch until the servo amplifier drops below 40 V<sub>DC</sub> before touching or manipulating the servo amplifier.
2. Disconnect the connectors. Finally, disconnect the connection to potential ground.
3. Check the temperature.
   During operation, the temperature of the servo amplifier heatsink may exceed 80 °C.
   Check the temperature before touching the device and wait until it drops below 40 °C.
4. Remove the device.
   Remove the servo amplifier and power supply from the conductive grounded cabinet mounting plate.
	
###Repair and disposal
The device may only be repaired by the manufacturer.
Opening the device will void the warranty.
Remove the device as described in the paragraph above and send it in the original packaging to the manufacturer.
The manufacturer accepts returned old equipment and accessories for professional disposal.
Shipping costs are paid by the sender.
