#TG Hall converter 5/24 V {#TGhall_1}
Level translation circuit for Hall sensors.
Converts a 5&nbsp;V input signals from Hall sensors to 24&nbsp;V signals suitable for TGZ digital inputs.
The maximum current at 5&nbsp;V is 0.5&nbsp;A.
For proper operation of the converter, it is only necessary to supply a voltage level of 24&nbsp;V.
The 5&nbsp;V level is generated internally by the converter and can be used for other purposes.
The consumption depends on how the Hall sensors are used and on the consumption of the other connected sensors.
For the standard voltage conversion, the current consumption is about 50&nbsp;mA.
