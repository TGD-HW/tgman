**TGZ+Motion** is composed of two parts, **TGMotion** and **TGZ servo amplifier**, combined to one unit.
It is hosted on the TGZ hardware and allows the real-time motion control by the EtherCAT fieldbus.
Both parts (TGMotion and TGZ servo drive) are fully described in own manuals.
This document describes the integration of the two products and possible deviations to their standard manuals.
